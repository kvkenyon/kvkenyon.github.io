## Who Am I

I'm Kevin Kenyon. I enjoy computer science and jiu jitsu and working out. I was born in Munich, Germany and now live in Austin, TX.
I went to the University of Texas at Austin for Computer Science. I think therefore I am.

I'm a Brown Belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under [Rodrigo Cabral](http://brazilianfightfactory.com/). I've been doing jiu jitsu since
2013.

Currently I'm working at Meta (Facebook) as a software engineer.
