## Who Am I

I'm Kevin Kenyon. I enjoy computer science, jiu jitsu, cryptocurrencies, chess, and reading/writing. I was born in Munich, Germany and now live in Austin, TX.
I went to the University of Texas at Austin for Computer Science. 

I'm a Brown Belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under [Rodrigo Cabral](http://brazilianfightfactory.com/). I've been doing jiu jitsu since
2013 and enjoy competing. My biggest achievement was a Bronze medal at IBJJF American Nationals in 2018 (purple belt).

Currently I'm enjoying not having a software engineering job and just working on things I find fulfilling.

I was laid off due to COVID-19 last June after switching into an AI Research Software Engineering role at IBM.

## What I'm Up To in 2021
1. Reading a lot of books
2. Contribute to open source (Bitcoin Core, others)
3. Looking for a software engineering job in Austin, TX or remote
4. Training a lot of Jiu Jitsu
